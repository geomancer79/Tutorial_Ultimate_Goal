/**
 * in reality, for these ftc applications, the system tends to be too noisy and can cause excessive volatility for a purely PID algorithm
 * which is why PID for velocity in FTC may not be ideal
 * check out PIDF for a more suitable algorithm
 * feedforward takes a look at the effect of PID in the system to compensate for future actions
 * future-based adjustment rather than feedback-based adjustment
 * might make a video on it in the future :o
